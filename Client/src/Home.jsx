          Driven by technology disruptions and a raging pandemic, global majors
          in the hi-tech industry are looking to scale and outcompete rivals by
          outsourcing critical pieces of development work to innovative design
          services partners. Large design services companies are unable to build
          a high quality pool of resources with specialized skills due to their
          large overheads and previous generation financial models. As a result,
          they can only subcontract and act as a distribution channel for niche,
          specialized smaller firms such as P2F that have built enduring supply
          chains at the right cost.

          Since inception, P2Fâ€™s expert teams have successfully taped out tens
          of complex SoCs in various domains and industry segments for major
          semiconductor and technology businesses worldwide. Our engineers are
